# Home Assistant Operating System

Home Assistant Operating System (formerly HassOS) is a Linux based operating system optimized to host [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) and its [Add-ons](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/).

Home Assistant Operating System uses Docker as Container engine. It by default deploys the Home Assistant Supervisor as a container. Home Assistant Supervisor in turn uses the Docker container engine to control Home Assistant Core and Add-Ons in separate containers. Home Assistant Operating System is **not** based on a regular Linux distribution like Ubuntu. It is built using [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) and it is optimized to run Home Assistant. It targets single board compute (SBC) devices like the Raspberry Pi or ODROID but also supports x86-64 systems with UEFI.

## Features

- Lightweight and memory-efficient
- Minimized I/O
- Over The Air (OTA) updates
- Offline updates

## Development

If you don't have experience with embedded systems, Buildroot or the build process for Linux distributions it is recommended to read up on these topics first (e.g. [Bootlin](https://bootlin.com/docs/) has excellent resources).

The Home Assistant Operating System documentation can be found on the [Home Assistant Developer Docs website](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/operating-system).

### Components

- **Bootloader:**
  - [Barebox](https://barebox.org/) for devices that support UEFI
  - [U-Boot](https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot) for devices that don't support UEFI
- **Operating System:**
  - [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) LTS Linux
- **File Systems:**
  - [SquashFS](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/squashfs.txt) for read-only file systems (using LZ4 compression)
  - [ZRAM](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/blockdev/zram.txt) for `/tmp`, `/var` and swap (using LZ4 compression)
- **Container Platform:**
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) for running Home Assistant components in containers
- **Updates:**
  - [RAUC](https://rauc.io/) for Over The Air (OTA) and USB updates
- **Security:**
  - [AppArmor](https://apparmor.net/) Linux kernel security module

### Development builds

The Development build GitHub Action Workflow is a manually triggered workflow
which creates Home Assistant OS development builds. The development builds are
available at [os-builds.home-assistant.io](https://os-builds.home-assistant.io/).
